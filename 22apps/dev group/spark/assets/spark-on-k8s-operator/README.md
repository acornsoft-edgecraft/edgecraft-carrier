## Community

* Join our [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CALBDHMTL) channel on [Kubernetes on Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/).
* Check out [who is using the Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark](docs/who-is-using.md).

## Project Status

**Project status:** *beta*

**Current API version:** *`v1beta2`*

**If you are currently using the `v1beta1` version of the APIs in your manifests, please update them to use the `v1beta2` version by changing `apiVersion: "sparkoperator.k8s.io/<version>"` to `apiVersion: "sparkoperator.k8s.io/v1beta2"`. You will also need to delete the `previous` version of the CustomResourceDefinitions named `sparkapplications.sparkoperator.k8s.io` and `scheduledsparkapplications.sparkoperator.k8s.io`, and replace them with the `v1beta2` version either by installing the latest version of the operator or by running `kubectl create -f manifest/crds`.**

Customization of Spark pods, e.g., mounting arbitrary volumes and setting pod affinity, is implemented using a Kubernetes [Mutating Admission Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/), which became beta in Kubernetes 1.9. The mutating admission webhook is disabled by default if you install the operator using the Helm [chart](charts/spark-operator-chart). Check out the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start-guide.md#using-the-mutating-admission-webhook) on how to enable the webhook.

## Prerequisites

* Version >= 1.13 of Kubernetes to use the [`subresource` support for CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#subresources), which became beta in 1.13 and is enabled by default in 1.13 and higher.

* Version >= 1.16 of Kubernetes to use the `MutatingWebhook` and `ValidatingWebhook` of `apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark is to use the Helm [chart](charts/spark-operator-chart/).

```bash
$ helm repo add spark-operator https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/spark-on-k8s-operator

$ helm install my-release spark-operator/spark-operator --namespace spark-operator --create-namespace
```

This will install the Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark into the namespace `spark-operator`. The operator by default watches and handles `SparkApplication`s in every namespaces. If you would like to limit the operator to watch and handle `SparkApplication`s in a single namespace, e.g., `default` instead, add the following option to the `helm install` command:

```
--set sparkJobNamespace=default
```

For configuration options available in the Helm chart, please refer to the chart's [README](charts/spark-operator-chart/README.md).

## Version Matrix

The following table lists the most recent few versions of the operator.

| Operator Version | API Version | Kubernetes Version | Base Spark Version | Operator Image Tag |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `latest` (master HEAD) | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `3.0.0` | `latest` |
| `v1beta2-1.3.3-3.1.1` | `v1beta2` | 1.16+ | `3.1.1` | `v1beta2-1.3.3-3.1.1` |
| `v1beta2-1.3.2-3.1.1` | `v1beta2` | 1.16+ | `3.1.1` | `v1beta2-1.3.2-3.1.1` |
| `v1beta2-1.3.0-3.1.1` | `v1beta2` | 1.16+ | `3.1.1` | `v1beta2-1.3.0-3.1.1` |
| `v1beta2-1.2.3-3.1.1` | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `3.1.1` | `v1beta2-1.2.3-3.1.1` |
| `v1beta2-1.2.0-3.0.0` | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `3.0.0` | `v1beta2-1.2.0-3.0.0` |
| `v1beta2-1.1.2-2.4.5` | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `2.4.5` | `v1beta2-1.1.2-2.4.5` |
| `v1beta2-1.0.1-2.4.4` | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `2.4.4` | `v1beta2-1.0.1-2.4.4` |
| `v1beta2-1.0.0-2.4.4` | `v1beta2` | 1.13+ | `2.4.4` | `v1beta2-1.0.0-2.4.4` |
| `v1beta1-0.9.0` | `v1beta1` | 1.13+ | `2.4.0` | `v2.4.0-v1beta1-0.9.0` |

When installing using the Helm chart, you can choose to use a specific image tag instead of the default one, using the following option:

```
--set image.tag=<operator image tag>
```

## Get Started

Get started quickly with the Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark using the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start-guide.md).

If you are running the Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark on Google Kubernetes Engine and want to use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and/or BigQuery for reading/writing data, also refer to the [GCP guide](docs/gcp.md).

For more information, check the [Design](docs/design.md), [API Specification](docs/api-docs.md) and detailed [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## Overview

The Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark aims to make specifying and running [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) applications as easy and idiomatic as running other workloads on Kubernetes. It uses
[Kubernetes custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
for specifying, running, and surfacing status of Spark applications. For a complete reference of the custom resource definitions, please refer to the [API Definition](docs/api-docs.md). For details on its design, please refer to the [design doc](docs/design.md). It requires Spark 2.3 and above that supports Kubernetes as a native scheduler backend.

The Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark currently supports the following list of features:

* Supports Spark 2.3 and up.
* Enables declarative application specification and management of applications through custom resources.
* Automatically runs `spark-submit` on behalf of users for each `SparkApplication` eligible for submission.
* Provides native [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) support for running scheduled applications.
* Supports customization of Spark pods beyond what Spark natively is able to do through the mutating admission webhook, e.g., mounting ConfigMaps and volumes, and setting pod affinity/anti-affinity.
* Supports automatic application re-submission for updated `SparkApplication` objects with updated specification.
* Supports automatic application restart with a configurable restart policy.
* Supports automatic retries of failed submissions with optional linear back-off.
* Supports mounting local Hadoop configuration as a Kubernetes ConfigMap automatically via `sparkctl`.
* Supports automatically staging local application dependencies to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via `sparkctl`.
* Supports collecting and exporting application-level metrics and driver/executor metrics to Prometheus.
